--  control signals:
--     reg_dst    : asserted for ADD instructions, so that the register
--                  destination number for the 'write_register' comes from
--                  the rd field (bits 3-0). 
--     reg_write  : asserted for ADD and LOAD instructions, so that the
--                  register on the 'write_register' input is written with
--                  the value on the 'write_data' port.
--     alu_src    : asserted for LOAD and STORE instructions, so that the
--                  second ALU operand is the sign-extended, lower 4 bits
--                  of the instruction.
--     mem_write  : asserted for STORE instructions, so that the data 
--                  memory contents designated by the address input are
--                  replaced by the value on the 'write_data' input.
--     mem_to_reg : asserted for LOAD instructions, so that the value fed
--                  to the register 'write_data' input comes from the
--                  data memory.
